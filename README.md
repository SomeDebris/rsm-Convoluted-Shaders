# Simple Shaders [by Debris]
A relatively simple shader mod that maintains the basic look and feel of the game, but spices up explosions, makes thruster trails look nicer, and makes colors oscillate faster and less predictably.

This mod is intended for Vanilla Tournament Play. I change the appearance of some things to make them easier to see in the arena etc. This may harm the apperance of your modded factions.

## Changes to default shaders:

- blocks:
    - block color oscillation occurs at a faster rate
    - block colors randomly deviate from either assigned color by small amounts (i.e. barely noticeable rainbow scintillation)
    - block bloom increased

- explosions:
    - explosion particle size increased
    - explosion circle decreases in size while fading out 
        - side effect: charging weapons flicker when getting ready to fire
    - explosion particle colors made more yellow and brighter
    - explosion trails made longer

- thrusters:
    - thruster particles made slower
    - thruster particles made slightly brighter
    - thruster particles are longer and more noticeable on missiles

- stars:
    - stars made more numerous
    - stars appear much farther away

- other:
    - shields deviate from their assigned color by small amounts (i.e. barely noticeable rainbow scintillation)
    - projectiles deviate from their assigned color by small amounts (i.e. barely noticeable rainbow scintillation)
    - laser deviates from their assigned color by small amounts (i.e. barely noticeable rainbow scintillation)
    - change port polygon from a square to a pentagon
    - add port normal lines
    - diminish command halo size
